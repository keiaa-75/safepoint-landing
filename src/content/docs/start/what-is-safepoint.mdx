SafePoint is a free and open-source web application designed to provide students with a safe, accessible, and trusted way to report bullying incidents and schedule counseling sessions.

## What we want to solve

Bullying is a critical issue that can severely harm a student's well-being and academic performance. Despite this, many students hesitate to report incidents.

Common barriers include:

- Fear of retaliation from peers
- Shame, stigma, or a desire to handle it alone
- Distrust in the existing systems to be confidential or effective

SafePoint is designed to be a supportive tool that overcomes these barriers by providing a clear, digital, and more private 'coping mechanism' for students to seek help.

## Our vision

This project was initiated as a beta test at Luis Y. Ferrer Jr. Senior High School to assess its usability and impact in a local context. The findings from this initial study are intended to guide the iterative refinement of the platform.

While this study is specific to our campus, the problem it addresses is universal. We are open to sharing our findings and methodology with other institutions. Hopefully, it can serve as a reference and offer preliminary insights, provided the platform's design is adapted to fit their own specific needs.

The ultimate goal of SafePoint is to foster a more responsive and supportive school environment. By providing an easy-to-use and reliable tool, we aim to ensure that students feel empowered and confident in reporting incidents, knowing they will be connected to the help they need.
