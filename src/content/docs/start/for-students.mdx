Welcome to SafePoint. We're here to help. This platform was created for you, providing a secure and straightforward way to get the support you need, right from your own device.

Whether you need to speak up about an incident or schedule a time to talk, SafePoint is your private connection to school counselors.

## How SafePoint helps

-   **File a report:** If you have experienced or witnessed bullying, you can create a confidential report. You decide what information to share, and it will only be visible to authorized staff who can help.
-   **Schedule a counseling session:** You can easily view available times and request an appointment with a counselor without needing to do so in person.
-   **Track your progress:** Your dashboard will show you the status of your reports and upcoming appointments, so you always know what's next.

<Aside type="note">
    We understand that confidentiality is essential. SafePoint is designed to be a secure space where you can feel safe sharing your concerns. Your information is protected and handled with care.

Taking the first step is often the hardest part. SafePoint is here to make it a little easier. You are not alone.
